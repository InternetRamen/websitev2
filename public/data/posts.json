            "content": "Sore... Everyone who intensely exercises knows this word like the back of their hands. \nFrom a little annoyance in your arm to being unable to move your legs, this inconvenience is often a reason to skip out on a day of exercise. \n\nBeing sore may seem like a completely awful part of every workout, however, controlled and healthy soreness should be embraced.\n\n## Mentality\nI believe that you should live life in its best light. Although there are multiple painful feelings that come along with soreness, soreness shows that you pushed past your limits (although normal exercise is perfectly healthy). Every time my muscles become sore after a dryland practice at swimming, I feel motivated to continue working hard because I know that I am trying my best. \n\n## Physically\nSoreness usually happens when muscles are pushed past their normal capacity, causing damage to muscle fibers. This results in the stiffness and pain that you may feel the day after a workout. I believe that my body is breaking down my muscles like a contractor demolishes a house. Even though the house may be gone, the skyscraper that will be built in its place is crucial for the development of the neighborhood. \n\nYou must mine through the coal to reach the diamonds *(Minecraft reference)*. You wouldn't stop mining just because you encountered coal on your first or second block. You would keep going because you know that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Healthy soreness is part of the ores you have to mine through to get to your goals. ",
